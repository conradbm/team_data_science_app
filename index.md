### Goal:
```mardown
-Find maximum similarity of a text with a pool of other texts
-Our prototype goal is to simulate this with bible chapters
-Another prototype idea would be: Given any bible chapter, return all other bible chapters sufficiently relevant to those found in that chapter from the same book (i.e., the bible)
```

### Example: 
```markdown
- Given a populated database with the book of Genesis (50 chapters, each containing a paragraph of verses combined)
- The user specifies Chapter 3 (talk about the garden of eden primarily), our model would do a predictive query through a model object build from the book of Genesis to find the most similar chapters and return those to the user for their further research on the subject.
```
