        <h3>Predictive Side of the Project:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>We need a statistics class to get word distributions for books, chapters, and verses</li>
        <li>We need a sentiment analyzer to determine if a verse was good, bad, or neurtral</li>
        <li>We need a topic modeling object to return the topics of a chapter</li>
        <ul> <li>The end goal here is to find maximum intersection of similar topics, say.. the top K</li> </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Set up the Flask Page</li>

        <li>Get all the piplines set up for data to flow through when the semantic analyzer is finished and predicting relatively good</li>
        <li> Someone make a really pretty web page using Bootstrap, CSS, JS, ect..</li>
